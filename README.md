To run my app, cd into the folder and then run:

python manage.py runserver

Then go to http://localhost:8000/

Log in with the username 'super' and the password 'user'

I spent a lot of time trying to get the login functionality to work so I didn't end up being able to complete the hashtag portion. I'm dealing with a family emergency and can provide documentation if needed.

I spent 10 hours on this project because I have no idea how Django works.

After you log in, you will see the splash page, where you can navigate to a home page or profile page.

If you go to admin/ you can see a list of tweets and add/remove them accordingly.

I was able to hit 4/5 of the requirements, if you are looking for additional functionality I implemented it in my final project (favoriting, log out, etc.) so adding it twice seemed rudundant and I already spent an immense amount of time on this homework, thanks!
